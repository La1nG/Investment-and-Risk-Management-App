# Investment-and-Risk-Management-App

## Overview

This is a sophisticated R Shiny application for financial time series forecasting and analysis. This app combines multiple forecasting models, ensemble techniques, and alternative data sources to provide comprehensive price predictions for various asset types, including stocks, forex, crypto, commodities, and indices.

# Key Features

- Multiple Forecasting Models: Implements ARIMAX, BSTS, Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM, Transformer, and TCN models for robust predictions

- Ensemble Methods: Combines model outputs using Simple Average, Weighted Average, Bayesian Model Averaging, Stacking, and Adaptive Ensemble techniques

- Market Regime Detection: Identifies different market states (low, normal, high volatility) and adapts forecasting accordingly

- Alternative Data Integration: Incorporates news sentiment analysis and macroeconomic indicators

- Technical Indicators: Calculates and visualizes RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and other technical indicators

- Uncertainty Quantification: Provides confidence intervals using bootstrap and Bayesian methods

- Model Diagnostics: Conducts comprehensive residual analysis and statistically validates model quality

- Interactive Visualization: Features dynamic, interactive charts powered by Plotly

# Implementation Details
Model Architecture:
- The app implements several state-of-the-art forecasting models:

- ARIMAX: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables
- BSTS: Bayesian Structural Time Series
- Prophet: Facebook's forecasting procedure
- XGBoost: Gradient boosting for time series
- LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory neural networks
- Transformer: Attention-based neural networks
- TCN: Temporal Convolutional Networks

## Ensemble Methods
- Multiple models are combined using sophisticated ensemble techniques:

- Bayesian Model Averaging: Weights models based on posterior probabilities
- Stacking: Trains a meta-learner on model outputs
- Adaptive Ensemble: Dynamically adjusts weights based on recent performance

## Uncertainty Quantification
The app provides two methods for calculating prediction intervals:

- Bootstrap: Resamples historical data to estimate forecast variability
- Bayesian: Leverages parameter uncertainty for probabilistic intervals
